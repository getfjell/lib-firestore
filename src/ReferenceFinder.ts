/**
 * Recursively builds a Firestore DocumentReference by traversing through collections and documents
 * using the provided keys and collection names. This method is specifically designed to work with
 * Fjell-managed documents in Firestore, which store references to other documents using a structured
 * key system (PriKey or LocKey). When a document needs to reference another document, this method
 * constructs the proper path to that document by following the reference chain.
 *
 * This method consumes keys and collections in reverse order (using pop()) to build a reference path.
 * Each key corresponds to a document ID within its respective collection.
 *
 * @template S - String type for primary keys
 * @template L1 - String type for location key level 1
 * @template L2 - String type for location key level 2
 * @template L3 - String type for location key level 3
 * @template L4 - String type for location key level 4
 * @template L5 - String type for location key level 5
 *
 * @param base - The starting point: either a Firestore instance or an existing DocumentReference
 * @param keys - Array of keys (PriKey or LocKey) that will be consumed to build the document path.
 *               WARNING: This array is mutated during execution (elements are popped off)
 * @param collections - Array of collection names corresponding to the keys.
 *                      WARNING: This array is mutated during execution (elements are popped off)
 *
 * @returns A DocumentReference pointing to the final document in the path
 *
 * @throws {Error} When the method runs out of keys or collections before completing the path
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Building a reference to: /users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}
 * const userKey = { pk: "user123" } as PriKey<"User">;
 * const orderKey = { pk: "order456" } as PriKey<"Order">;
 * const keys = [userKey, orderKey];
 * const collections = ["users", "orders"];
 *
 * const docRef = addReference(firestore, keys, collections);
 * // Result: DocumentReference to /users/user123/orders/order456
 * ```
 *
 * @remarks
 * **Known Issues:**
 * - The method mutates the input arrays by using pop(), which can cause unexpected behavior
 *   for callers who may not expect their arrays to be modified
 * - When base is a Firestore instance and keys array is empty, the cast to DocumentReference
 *   may not be type-safe
 * - Callers must be aware that their input arrays will be modified after calling this method
 *
 * **Behavior Details:**
 * - If keys array is empty, returns the base cast as DocumentReference (base case for recursion)
 * - For each iteration, pops one key and one collection name from their respective arrays
 * - Determines if key is a PriKey or LocKey and extracts the appropriate identifier (pk or lk)
 * - Creates a new DocumentReference by chaining collection(collectionName).doc(keyValue)
 * - Recursively calls itself with the new DocumentReference and remaining keys/collections

/**
 * Main entry point for constructing Firestore references from Fjell key structures.
 * This method serves as the primary interface for operations that need to locate documents
 * in Firestore using Fjell's structured key system.
 *
 * This method acts as a safe wrapper around addReference by:
 * - Creating defensive copies of input arrays to prevent mutation
 * - Converting various key formats into a standardized key array
 * - Handling the special case of LocKeys that require an additional collection reference
 *
 * @template S - String type for primary keys
 * @template L1 - String type for location key level 1
 * @template L2 - String type for location key level 2
 * @template L3 - String type for location key level 3
 * @template L4 - String type for location key level 4
 * @template L5 - String type for location key level 5
 *
 * @param key - The key structure representing the document to reference. Can be:
 *              - ComKey: A composite key containing both primary and location components
 *              - PriKey: A primary key for direct document access
 *              - LocKeyArray: An array of location keys for nested document paths
 *              - []: Empty array for root-level collection access
 * @param collectionNames - Array of collection names that define the Firestore path structure.
 *                          Each collection name corresponds to a level in the document hierarchy.
 * @param firestore - The Firestore instance to build references against
 *
 * @returns One of three possible reference types:
 *          - DocumentReference: When the path resolves to a specific document
 *          - CollectionReference: When the path resolves to a collection (typically with LocKeys)
 *          - Firestore: In edge cases where no path is constructed (rare)
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Getting a document reference using a primary key
 * const userKey = { pk: "user123" } as PriKey<"User">;
 * const docRef = getReference(userKey, ["users"], firestore);
 * // Result: DocumentReference to /users/user123
 *
 * // Getting a collection reference using location keys
 * const locationKeys = [{ lk: "region1" }, { lk: "store1" }] as LocKeyArray<"Region", "Store">;
 * const collectionRef = getReference(locationKeys, ["regions", "stores", "products"], firestore);
 * // Result: CollectionReference to /regions/region1/stores/store1/products
 *
 * // Getting a nested document reference using composite key
 * const compositeKey = {
 *   pk: "order123",
 *   lks: [{ lk: "customer456" }]
 * } as ComKey<"Order", "Customer">;
 * const docRef = getReference(compositeKey, ["customers", "orders"], firestore);
 * // Result: DocumentReference to /customers/customer456/orders/order123
 * ```
 *
 * @remarks
 * **Safety Features:**
 * - Creates defensive copies of input arrays to prevent mutation (unlike addReference)
 * - Handles multiple key formats through the generateKeyArray utility
 * - Provides type safety through extensive generic constraints
 *
 * **Special Behavior:**
 * - When using LocKeys, the method automatically appends the final collection to create
 *   a CollectionReference rather than stopping at a DocumentReference
 * - This allows for querying collections filtered by location hierarchy
 *
 * **Usage Context:**
 * This method is the primary interface used by Fjell operations to:
 * - Locate existing documents for read/update operations
 * - Construct parent references for creating new documents
 * - Build collection references for queries within specific contexts
